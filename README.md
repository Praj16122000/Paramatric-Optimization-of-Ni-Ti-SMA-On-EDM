Spark erosion machining, also known as electro-discharge machining, is commonly 
used to machine hard materials, which is hard to do by using the traditional machining 
process. EDM is prominently used for machining advanced materials like ceramic, 
composite, metal matrix composite, etc. which is most popular in various fields of 
application like automobiles, aerospace, defense, etc. EDM machines advanced 
materials effectively, therefore electro-discharge machining is the most popular among 
traditional machining processes. Shape memory alloys exhibit survival composition out 
of which nickel-titanium alloy became relatively popular for its biomedical application 
due to high corrosion and wear resistance, pseudo elasticity, and biocompatibility. 
Nickel-titanium-based shape memory alloy also found its application in various fields 
like automotive aerospace, actuators, sensors, and especially biomedical.
Nickeltitanium-based shape memory alloy has been found to be hard also, therefore, it isvery 
difficult to machine by using a traditional machining process hence non-traditional 
machining process is utilized to machine nickel-titanium-based shape memory alloys. 
Being the most versatile of all nonconventional machining, the electric discharge 
machining (EDM) process becomes viable for the machining of these hard-to-machine 
materials. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of input parameters such 
as pulse on time, current and flushing pressure on output responses of MRR and SR on
nickel-titanium-based shape memory alloy. Taguchi L27 orthogonal array design has 
been utilized to conduct an experiment and also for optimization
